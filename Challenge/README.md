# San Fransisco Rental/Housing Analysis

 The Analyst was tasked with creating an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The proptech company where The Analyst is employed wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.
 
 The Analyst uses their data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.
